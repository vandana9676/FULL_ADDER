# FULL_ADDER
# Aim:
To simulate and synthesis Full adder using vivado.

# Apparatus Required:
vivado 2023.2 software.

# 
Procedure:
STEP:1 Start the vivado software, Select and Name the New project.

STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed.

STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type.

STEP:4 Type the File Name and module name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it.

STEP:5 Select the run simulation and then run Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax.

STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table.

STEP:7 compare the output with truth table.

# Program:
module FA(a,b,cin,sum,cout);

input a,b,cin;

output sum,cout;

wire w1,w2,w3;

xor g1(w1,a,b);

and g2(w2,w1,cin);

and g3(w3,a,b);

xor g4(sum,w1,cin);

or g5(cout,w2,w3);

endmodule

# Result:
 Thus the verilog program for Full adder has been simulated and verified successfully.
